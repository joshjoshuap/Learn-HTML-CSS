              Chair is a piece of furniture with a raised surface supported by
              legs, commonly used to seat a single person. Chairs are supported
              most often by four legs and have a back; however, a chair can have
              three legs or can have a different shape. Chairs are made of a
              wide variety of materials, ranging from wood to metal to synthetic
              material (e.g. plastic), and they may be padded or upholstered in
              various colors and fabrics, either just on the seat (as with some
              dining room chairs) or on the entire chair. Chairs are used in a
              number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and
              dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other

              A hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather
              than of an image formed by a lens, and it is used to display a
              fully three-dimensional image of the holographed subject, which is
              seen without the aid of special glasses or other intermediate
              optics. The hologram itself is not an image and it is usually
              unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light. It is an
              encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of
              seemingly random variations in the opacity, density, or surface
              profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the
              interference pattern diffracts the light into a reproduction of
              the original light field and the objects that were in it appear to
              still be there, exhibiting visual depth cues such as parallax and
              perspective that change realistically with any change in the
              relative position of the observer. A hologram is a photographic
